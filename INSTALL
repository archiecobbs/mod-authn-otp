To build and install mod_authn_otp:

    1. Ensure you have the following software packages installed:

        apache2-devel
        openssl-devel
        apache2-dev (Ubuntu)
        build-essential (Ubuntu)

    2. If you are building from GITHUB SOURCE instead of distribution tarball:

        2.1. Ensure you have the following software packages installed:

              autoconf
              automake

        2.2  Run `./autogen.sh`

    3. Run `./configure'
    4. Run `make'
    5. Run `make install'

Once the module is installed on your system, you'll also need to do the
following steps to add it to Apache:

    1. Add the "mod_authn_otp" module to your Apache config. This usually
       involves adding a line looking something like this:

        LoadModule authn_otp_module /usr/lib64/apache2/mod_authn_otp.so

       There should already be a bunch of similar "LoadModule" lines nearby.

    2. Enable the "mod_authn_otp" module, typically by running this command:

        a2enmod authn_otp

    3. Restart Apache
