.Nd one-time password utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm otptool

.Op Fl fhtx
.Op Fl c Ar counter
.Op Fl d Ar ndig
.Op Fl i Ar secs
.Op Fl w Ar num
.Ar key
.Op Ar otp

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility for generating, verifying, and synchronizing one-time passwords
created using the HOTP algorithm defined by RFC 4226.
.Pp
If no
.Ar otp
is given,
.Nm
generates the one-time password corresponding to the given key and counter value.
If
.Ar otp
is given, then
.Nm
verifies that
.Ar otp
is the correct one-time password for the given
.Ar key
and counter value.
.Pp
The key is specified as a hexadecimal value.
The counter value is determined as follows: if the
.Fl t
flag is given, use the current time since the UNIX epoch and the configured time interval (default 30 seconds);
otherwise, if the
.Fl c
flag is given, use the value provided;
otherwise, use the value zero.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Specify the target counter value for an event based HOTP token.
This is the starting value for the one-time password generation or search.
The default value is zero.
This flag is incompatible with the
.Fl t
flag.
.It Fl d
Specify the number of digits in the one-time password.
Giving an
.Ar otp
argument and specifying a different length here will result in no match being found.
If this flag is not given, the default value is the length of the given
.Ar otp ,
if any, otherwise six.
.It Fl f
Read the key from the file named
.Ar key
instead of parsing it as a hexadecimal string.
.It Fl h
Print the usage message and exit.
.It Fl i
Specify the length in seconds of a single time interval.
Default value is 30 seconds.
This flag is ignored unless the
.Fl t
flag is also given.
.It Fl t
Use the current time as the basis for the target counter value.
.It Fl w
Specify the width of a window of counter values within which to iterate when
generating or searching for one-time passwords.
When
.Fl t
is used, the window extends the given distance both before and after the target counter value;
otherwise, the window extends forward of the target counter value.
.It Fl x
Use hexadecimal encoding for the one-time password instead of decimal.
