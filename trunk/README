mod_authn_otp - Basic and digest authentication using one-time passwords

mod_authn_otp adds support to Apache for two-factor authentication using
a password consisting of an (optional) PIN number and a one-time password
(OTP) generated using the HOTP algorithm defined in RFC 4226. This allows
web site authentication via any RFC 4226-compliant token device.

mod_authn_otp supports both event and time based one-time passwords. It
also supports "lingering" which allows the repeated re-use of a previously
used one-time password up to a configurable maximum linger time. This
allows one-time passwords to be used directly in HTTP authentication
without forcing the user to enter a new OTP for every page load.

mod_authn_otp supports both basic and digest authentication, and will
auto-synchronize with the user's token within a configurable maximum
offset (auto-synchronization is not supported with digest authentication).
