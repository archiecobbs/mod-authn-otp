== Getting Tokens ==

Any [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4226.txt RFC 4226] compatible one-time password generator should work with *mod_authn_otp*.

You will need a token that is not tied to a specific vendor by way of proprietary design or withholding of information. For example, [http://www.verisign.com/authentication/consumer-authentication/identity-protection/index.html Verisign's VIP] tokens are not compatible because it is not possible to extract the token's key.

Note that the token key is not the same thing as the token ID, which is typically a alphanumeric string like MATM89382348. The token ID is simply a identifier for the token. The token key is typically 16 to 20 bytes of random binary data looking something like "f136803ab9c241079ba0cc1b5d02ee7765df3421".

I will list compatible tokens here as people report them...
