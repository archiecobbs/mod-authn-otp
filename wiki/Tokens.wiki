#summary Getting tokens for use with mod_authn_otp

== Supported Tokens ==

Any [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4226.txt RFC 4226] compatible one-time password generator from which you can access the token key should work with *mod_authn_otp*.

You will need a token that is not tied to a specific vendor by way of proprietary design or withholding of information. For example, [http://www.verisign.com/authentication/consumer-authentication/identity-protection/index.html Verisign's VIP] tokens are not compatible because it is not possible to extract the token's key.

Note that the token key is not the same thing as the token ID, which is typically a alphanumeric string like MATM89382348. The token ID is simply a identifier for the token. The token key is typically 16 to 20 bytes of random binary data looking something like "f136803ab9c241079ba0cc1b5d02ee7765df3421".

=== Hardware Tokens ===

  * [http://www.authworks.com/authenex-akey-3600.asp Authenex's A-Key 3600] is compatible and has been successfully tested.
  * [http://www.aladdin.com/etoken/devices/pass.aspx Aladdin's eToken PASS] should work according to the description but has not actually been tested.

=== Software Tokens ===

  * [http://www.securethecloud.com/mobile-client-pledge/ Nordic Edge's Pledge] is an event based software token that runs on the iPhone and cell phones. Follow the instructions for a free profile, then enter the token key into your *mod_authn_otp* users file.
