#summary The users database

== Overview ==

The users file contains the secret information about users, PINs, and token keys on the server. It's location is configured via the {{{OTPAuthUsersFile}}} directive. This file is updated (rewritten) whenever the server needs to save new information. Therefore, you should only edit it when the server is stopped (or no authentication is occurring).

You will need to create this file manually and be sure to set the permissions correctly (see below). Each line defines one user+token combination. Currently a user may only have a single associated token.

Users may have an arbitrary length PIN, or a dash ("-") for no PIN. If a PIN is defined, it must precede the one-time password in the HTTP password field. For example, if a user has PIN "1234" and the token generates the one-time password of "567890", then the user must enter "1234567890" as their password for HTTP authentication.

Tokens must be configured as event tokens or time tokens and of course the token's key must be entered. In addition, you may optionally specify the initial counter value (for event tokens) or relative time period offset adjustment (for time tokens); both values default to zero if not specified.

See OneTimePasswords and [Tokens] for more information about how one-time passowords and tokens work.

== Permissions ==

The Apache web server must have permission to create files in the same directory as this file, and to delete (overwrite) this file with an updated copy. This is because the way *mod_authn_otp* updates the file is by writing out a new version under a temporary name and then renaming the temporary file to the real one.

For example, on [http://www.opensuse.org/ openSuSE Linux] this means the file and parent directory should be owned by user {{{wwwrun}}} and group {{{www}}}.

If it's not already obvious, because it contains sensitive security information *never put this file where it could be publicly visible*. For example, it should probably be in a directory whose parent directory is only readable by root.

== Format ==

An example users file is included in the distribution and is reproduced here:
{{{
# Example users file for mod_authn_otp
#
# Fields:
#
# 1. Token Type         'E' for event based, 'T' for time based
# 2. Username           User's username
# 3. PIN                User's PIN prefix or "-" if user has no PIN
# 4. Token Key          Secret key for the token algorithm (see RFC 4226)
# 5. Counter/Offset     Next expected counter value (event tokens) or counter offset (time tokens)
# 6. Last OTP           The previous successfully used one-time password
# 7. Time of Last OTP   Local timestamp when the last OTP was generated (in the form 2009-06-12T17:52:32L)
#
# Fields 5 and beyond are optional. Fields 6 and beyond should be omitted for new users.

== Locking ==

*mod_authn_otp* creates a lock file in the same directory as the users file in order to synchronize server threads so they don't try to update the users file at the same time. The file is empty; it just needs to be there so it can be locked.
