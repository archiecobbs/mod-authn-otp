#summary How to get tokens that produce compatible one time passwords

Any [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4226.txt RFC 4226] compatible one-time password generator should work with mod_authn_otp.

You will need a token that is not tied to a specific vendor by way of proprietary design or withholding of information. For example, [http://www.verisign.com/authentication/consumer-authentication/identity-protection/index.html Verisign's VIP] tokens are not compatible because it is not possible to extract the token's key.

Several compatible software tokens exist for mobile phones, for example [http://www.securethecloud.com/mobile-client-pledge/ Nordic Edge's Pledge] app (follow the instructions for a free profile, then enter the token key into your mod_authn_otp users file).
